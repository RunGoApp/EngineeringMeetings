# Learning

## What I want to learn

 - Tizen Development for Galaxy Watch
 - Are there any cross platfrom Andriod/Tizen platfroms

## What I learned
- Setup Tizen Studio and made basic "Hello World" type app
- Tizen Studio can create Native (C or C++) or Web (Javascript, CSS) apps. The web apps are more limited.
- Xamarin Tizen .net offers some cross platform support, but still is C++ based. But usign .net may have some development advantages https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/other/tizen
