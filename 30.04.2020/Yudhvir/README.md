## What I want to learn

 - Basic COBOL (Print Hello World)

## What I learned
- COBOL is a high-level language
- COBOL code must be converted into machine code using a compiler
- The compiler creates an output file which is known as load module
- Logical control structures are available in COBOL which makes it easier to read and modify. COBOL has different divisions, so it is easy to debug.
- Sections are the logical subdivision of program logic. A section is a collection of paragraphs.
- Paragraphs are the subdivision of a section or division. It is either a user-defined or a predefined name followed by a period, and consists of zero or more sentences/entries.
- Sentences are the combination of one or more statements. Sentences appear only in the Procedure division. A sentence must end with a period.
- Statements are meaningful COBOL statements that perform some processing.
- Characters are the lowest in the hierarchy and cannot be divisible.
