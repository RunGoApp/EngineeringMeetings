## What I learned

The differences between AR, VR, and MR

AR - Augmented reality adds digital elements to a live view.
VR - Virtual reality is an immersive experience that shuts out the physical world.
MR - Mixed reality is a combination of AR and VR where real world objects and digital objects interact. An existing example of MR is the Microsoft Hololens.

What makes good design for Virtual Reality?
The key to virtual reality is creating a seamless, intuitive experience that immerses the user entirely.

1. User Comfort - transitioning the user from the real world to an alternate world should be smooth as it may be a shocking and disorienting experience to some. A good tip to create a smooth transition is avoiding information overload and keeping the interface as simple as possible. This will also make guiding the user throughout the experience much easier as a designer.
2. Multimodal Interaction - the user should be able to interact with digital objects through movement of their arms, head, and body.
3. Spatial/3D Audio - this is necessary to create a deeper sense of immersion in the virtual realm. Designers can also use spatial audio to draw users attention.
4. Physical Space - spacial awareness must be considered in inches/feet instead of the pixels (which is standard in the 2D design world), considering user behaviour for the vr application and the physical space required is important for user experience, comfort, and safety

Things to consider
- be familiar with user behaviours. The first thing users tend to do when being immersed in VR is look around - this knowledge can be used to better guide the user by predicting their behaviours based on patterns and previous research
- honesty is important; allow the user the freedom of choice, safety, identity and privacy without coercion or deception
